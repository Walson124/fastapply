            <ul>
                <li>Applications take a lot of time and are often repetitive, tedious work</li>
                <li>It is difficult to keep track of all open positions</li>
                <li>It is normal to apply when requirements are not met (therefore error is allowed)</li>
                <li>
                    All the source code is viewable, and your data is not being saved on the cloud
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            To use python this app will use PyScript, so your info won't be safe from the browser (won't be safe if there's malicious software already on your browser)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            <p class="topic-label">How does the website work?</p>
            <p>First, you fill in some of the most common questions that job applications ask for, 
                such as contact info, experience, links, ethnicity, veteran/disability status, etc.</p>
            <p>Using this info and search queries of your choice (e.g. 'Accountant' or 'Business Analyst' or 'Software Developer Intern'),
                the jss and python will lookup jobs from the sites of your choice (options are LinkedIn, Indeed, and Handshake).</p>
            <p>Using the credentials you provide, the python will apply for all the jobs that your information covers
                (if the sites require extra information, the application will not be completed, but the application link will recorded).</p>
            <p>After all applications are done (or user stops first), two files will be downloaded:
                one for the fill-in information, and one for the application information
            </p>
            <p>Next time you use the site, you can just upload the files so you don't need to fill in the information again, 
                and you won't apply to something twice!</p>

            <p class="topic-label">Do note, project is WIP</p>
            <p>Difficult part will be doing backend without server, not sure if it'll even work</p>
            <p>At the end of the day, this is anothe project to help me develop my skills :)</p>
